At one official blow, so to speak, Battersea is denuded of all its C's, and left to get on as best it can with the rest of the alphabet.

We settle down with a rollicking ease into our seats (for we are a bold, devil-may-care race, the C's of Battersea), and an oath is administered to us in a totally inaudible manner by an individual resembling an Army surgeon in his second childhood.
