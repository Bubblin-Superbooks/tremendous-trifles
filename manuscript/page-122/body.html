The evening was settling down between all the buildings with that slow gold that seems to soak everything when we went into the church.</p><p>In the growing darkness of the church, my eye caught the coloured windows which on that clear golden evening were flaming with all the passionate heraldry of the most fierce and ecstatic of Christian arts.
