But very likely the same young man does not know the French for a shoe-horn. But to this generalisation there are three great exceptions. (1 In the case of countries that are not European at all, and have never had our civic conceptions, or the old Latin scholarship. I do not pretend that the Patagonian phrase for “citizenship” at once leaps to the mind, or that a Dyak's word for “the Republic” has been familiar to me from the nursery. (2 In the case of Germany, where, although the principle does apply to many words such as “nation” and “philosophy,” it does not apply so generally, because Germany has had a special and deliberate policy of encouraging the purely German part of its language. (3) In the case where one does not know any of the language at all, as is generally the case with me.) )</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
