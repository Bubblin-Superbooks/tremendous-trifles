<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">suddenly go mad. We only know that there is a real revolution because all the chimney-pots go mad on the whole skyline of the city.</p><p>Just as the ragged outline of a tree grows suddenly more ragged and rises into fantastic crests or tattered tails, so the human city rises under the wind of the spirit into toppling temples or sudden spires. No man has ever seen a revolution. Mobs pouring through the palaces, blood pouring down the gutters, the guillotine lifted higher than the throne, a prison in ruins, a people in armsâ€”these things are not revolution, but the results of revolution.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">You cannot see a wind; you can only see that there is a wind. So, also, you cannot see a revolution; you can only see that there is a revolution. And there never has been in the history of the world a real revolution, brutally active and decisive, which was not preceded by unrest and new dogma in the reign of invisible things.</p></div> </div>
