  I have seen Gainsborough and the grass.
“(O given to believe a lie,
 O my mad mother, do do not die,
 Whose eyes turn all ways but within,
 Whose sin is innocence of sin,
 Whose eyes, blinded with beams at noon,
 Can see the motes upon the moon,
 You shall your lover still pursue.
 To what last madhouse shelters you
 I will uphold you, even I.
 You that are dead.  You shall not die.)”</p></blockquote><p>But the sea would not stop for me any more than for Canute; and as for the German band, that would not stop for anybody.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
