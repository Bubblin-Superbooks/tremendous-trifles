<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">poster of vivid violet, on which I see written in large black letters these remarkable words: “Should Shop Assistants Marry?”</p><hr class="section"><p class=" stretch-last-line ">When I saw those words everything might just as well have turned upside down. The men in Fleet Street might have been walking about on their hands. The cross of St. Paul's might have been hanging in the air upside down. For I realise that I have really come into a topsy-turvy country; I have come into the country where men do definitely believe that the waving of the trees makes the wind. That is to say, they believe that the material circumstances, however black and twisted, are more important than the spiritual realities, however powerful and pure. “Should Shop Assistants Marry?” I am puzzled to think what some periods and schools of human history would have made of such a question.</p></div> </div>
