Sparta killed Athens with a final blow, and she was born again. Sparta went away victorious, and died slowly of her own wounds.

It is something if we can shock and jar the unthinking impetus and enormous innocence of evil; just as a pebble on a railway can stagger the Scotch express. It is enough for the great martyrs and criminals of the French revolution, that they have surprised for all time the secret weakness of the strong. They have awakened and set leaping and quivering in his crypt for ever the coward in the hearts of kings.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
